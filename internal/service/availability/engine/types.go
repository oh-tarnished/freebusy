// Package engine is the pure availability compute engine. It has no I/O: given a
// unit's config, its active reservations, and its closures, it computes the
// bookable shape (per-night counts for NIGHTLY units, discrete slots for TIME_SLOT
// units), tests exact spans, coalesces bookable ranges, and produces search
// matches with a lead price. The read side (internal/service/availability/db)
// supplies the inputs; this package owns the booking-availability rules.
